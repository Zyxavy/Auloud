# Decision Log

One entry per decision, newest at the bottom. Status: **Accepted** (you decided) or **Proposed** (suggested in the design docs, not yet confirmed by you). Change a status when you confirm or reverse something, and add a new entry rather than deleting an old one.

### D-001: Personal project, possibly open-source

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Build for personal use first; release as open source later if it works well.
- Why: Solves a real personal need; open-sourcing later keeps options open.
- Consequences: Keep licenses clean from the start (see `08-Licenses.md`).

### D-002: Android first, iOS later

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Target Android now; iOS is not part of v1.
- Why: Main device is Android, and Android's background audio model is easier to work with.

### D-003: Target device is the Samsung Galaxy Tab E (SM-T560NU), Android 7.1.1

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: `minSdk 24`; design for about 1.5 GB RAM (to be verified on the unit).
- Why: It's the device the user actually has.
- Consequences: Limits library versions and APIs; later Android versions are a v3 goal.

### D-004: English only for v1

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted

### D-005: All synthesis happens on a PC or server in v1

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: The tablet does not run TTS in v1. A PC renders the audiobook; the app plays it.
- Why: The Tab E cannot handle neural TTS in real time.
- Alternatives considered: on-device Piper/Kokoro (deferred to v2), streaming from a server.
- Revisit when: the v2 benchmark spike measures real-time factors on devices.

### D-006: The app stores the original EPUB/PDF plus the audiobook; three modes

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Read only, listen only, and read + listen with a synced highlight.
- Why: Lets the user switch freely between reading and listening.

### D-007: Use the SLC lifecycle for v1

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Aim for a Simple, Lovable, Complete first release, built in five slices.
- Consequences: Each slice ends with something runnable on the tablet; see `04-Roadmap.md`.

### D-008: Roadmap for later versions

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: v2 embeds the EPUB/PDF in the app so the device runs its own TTS (Kokoro or Piper); v3 supports later Android versions.

### D-009: Audio format: mono MP3, 24 kHz, 64 kbps CBR, one file per chapter

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Proposed (MP3 chosen by user; the exact parameters are suggested)
- Why: Universal playback; CBR keeps seeking and timestamps accurate; about 29 MB per hour.
- Alternatives considered: Opus (smaller), AAC/M4A.
- Revisit when: sync tests show drift, or storage becomes a problem.

### D-010: Sync map generated at synthesis time (sentence-level)

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Proposed
- Why: Scribe knows each sentence's exact duration, so no forced alignment is needed.
- Consequences: Timings come from one continuous buffer per chapter (see spec section 6).

### D-011: v1 reader displays Scribe's cleaned text; original file is stored but not rendered

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Proposed
- Why: Exact sync and low memory use on the Tab E.
- Revisit when: real EPUB rendering (v1.1 backlog) is worth the cost.

### D-012: PDFs use page-level sync in v1

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Proposed
- Why: Word-level highlighting in fixed-layout PDFs is much harder; preferring PDF-to-text on the PC where possible.

### D-013: Speaker attribution is rule-based in v1; LLM is optional later

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Proposed
- Why: Keeps v1 simple; low-confidence lines are reviewed via `cast_report.md` and fixed in `cast.yaml`.

### D-014: Storage access behind a `BundleStorage` interface

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Proposed
- Why: v1 uses file paths and the legacy storage permission (works on Android 7); v3 can swap in Storage Access Framework without rewriting the app.

### D-015: Licenses: Player Apache-2.0 (or MIT), Scribe GPL-3.0

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Proposed
- Why: Piper and espeak-ng are GPL, so the PC tool that wraps them is GPL; the tablet app ships no GPL code in v1.
- Revisit when: v2 on-device TTS, or if Scribe is hosted as a service (AGPL considerations); see `08-Licenses.md`.

### D-016: No network permission in v1

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Proposed
- Why: Fully offline; simpler privacy story.

### D-017: Project documentation set

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Keep `01-PRD` to `08-Licenses`, `README`, and this log as the project docs.

### D-018: Project name is Readio (superseded by D-019)

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Superseded by D-019
- Decision: The project is called Readio; the PC tool is Readio Scribe and the Android app is Readio Player.
- Why: Chosen by the user.
- Consequences / revisit when: before public release, search GitHub, F-Droid, the Play Store and trademark databases for conflicts.

### D-019: Project name is Auloud

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: The project is called Auloud (audio + aloud); the PC tool is Auloud Scribe and the Android app is Auloud Player.
- Why: Chosen by the user after weighing other names.
- Consequences / revisit when: before public release, search GitHub, F-Droid, the Play Store and trademark databases for conflicts, and check that "Auloud" is the spelling you want.

### D-020: Scribe is a CLI first; keep logic in a library; GUI later

- Date: 2026-09-29
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Auloud Scribe ships as a CLI on Windows 11 for v1. Core logic lives in the `scribe/` Python library and the CLI is a thin wrapper, so a GUI can be added on top later. Add `scribe doctor` (checks Python, ffmpeg, espeak-ng, models, GPU) and `scribe voices --sample` (plays a test line per voice). A local web UI for reviewing speakers and voices (`scribe ui`) is a v1.1 backlog item. A packaged desktop app is only worth it if non-technical people will use Scribe.
- Why: The user is the only user for now; risk is in text, timing and audio, not the interface; the review step is the only place a GUI adds real value.
- Alternatives considered: a full desktop app (PySide6 or Tauri) now; a web UI in v1.
- Consequences: Use `uv` or `pipx` for install on Windows; print the real-time factor on build; the sentence cache keeps long builds resumable. Revisit when the project is released to non-technical users.
